# peepdf-3 - peepdf for Python 3

peepdf-3 is a **Python 3 tool to explore PDF files** in order to find out if the file can be harmful or not. The aim of this tool is to provide all the necessary components that
a security researcher could need in a PDF analysis without using 3 or 4 tools to make
all the tasks.  

With peepdf it's possible to see all the objects in the document showing
the suspicious elements, supports all the most used filters and encodings, it can parse different versions of a file, object streams and encrypted files. With the installation
of [STPyV8](https://github.com/cloudflare/stpyv8) and [Pylibemu](https://github.com/buffer/pylibemu) it provides **Javascript and shellcode analysis** wrappers too. Apart of this it's able to create new PDF files and to modify/obfuscate existent ones.

As of version 3.0.0, peepdf-3 no longer includes pylibemu as a **requirement**. This will enable use of peepdf-3 on Windows systems. However, all functionality of libemu, pylibemu, and sctest still exist, and will function on Linux systems, with these modules installed.
