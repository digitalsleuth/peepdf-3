## peepdf 3.0.0, 2024-01-02


	* Fixes:

		- AES decryption inaccurately determines the default password is incorrect
		- When supplying a file name, previous versions wouldn't check to see if the file existed before attempting actions
		- Parsing of rawobjects only returned identical information instead of actual raw data
		- Fixed an error whereby the ID did not parse correctly when using the `info trailer` command (when the ID is present)
		- Fixed the URL for the VT report, was previously directing to the API call, not the actual standard web location

	* Changes:

		- **NOTE** Removed pylibemu as a requirement to allow an installation on Windows systems. All libemu/pylibemu/sctest functions will still work on linux, provided libemu and pylibemu are installed.
		- Moved the lzw, jjdecode, and ccitt modules to their own encode/decode module, PDFEnDec.py
		- Moved the aes module into PDFCrypto.py
		- Renamed main.py to peepdf.py (to fit better naming structure and usage)
		- Added clarity to the interactive console commands and their outputs (modified help menus, explained outputs)
		- Added feedback to the redirect functions of the interactive console to confirm success / failure of action
		- Modified the error handling and argument parsing on initial launch to better handle multiple arguments

	* New Features:

		- Added a `json` and `xml` option in the interactive console to print the xml and json output of the currently loaded file
		- Added `objects` and `streams` options to the interactive console to show all objects and streams without having to resend the `info` command
		- Added a `clear` command to the interactive console to clear the screen
		- Not previously documented, but an `ocr` command has been added to the command line and interactive shells to extract text from the PDF
		- Added the document "ID" to the XML and JSON outputs
  
  
## peepdf 2.3.0, 2024-01-02


    * Fixes:

        - Fixed an issue whereby a race condition was caused which failed to "decrypt" hexadecimal JS objects when ID values were set to True too soon.


## peepdf 2.2.0, 2023-12-28


	* Fixes:

		- Fixed an error introduced when streamTrailer is None


## peepdf 2.1.0, 2023-12-28


	* Fixes:

		- AES decryption had several type errors (as indicated in Issue #5). These have been fixed.
		- The string for the ID was getting unintentionally decoded from string to hex, leaving an illegible ID string
		- Added error handling for the missing ID from the Trailer

	* Changes:

		- Updated PDFVulns.py to contain the Elements and Actions to be watched
		- The "title" of the document sometimes would contain unusable characters if decryption failed. Now will check for ascii content before outputting title.


## peepdf 2.0.0, 2023-12-11


	* Fixes:

		- Fixed JavaScript detection, whereby if the line contained even one invalid character, the remainder of the line would be ignored.
		- Fixed the incorrect implementation of iterating over .keys(), which subsequently fixed the "filters" option.
		- Filters not parsing correctly, and not providing a nicer output (hex column expanded to fill instead of stop at last character).
		- Changed the initial and do_info output to show full count of Suspicious Elements.
		- Hash values not being calculated properly for the "info" on objects when instantiated as strings.

	* Changes:

		- Updated the VirusTotal API to use API 3.
		- Moved the JS and other vulnerabilities to a separate single file, PDFVulns.py.
		- Changed optparse to argparse for better flexibility and support

	* New Features:

		- If present, the PDF title will be displayed in the output.
		- Added (re-introduced) an "update" feature to update the PDFVulns.py file separately, allowing for updating of list of vulnerabilities without having to re-install peepdf.
		- Added an ocr feature which will extract text from the PDF itself. Allows for additional context during analysis.
		- Added the -k argument at the shell to allow the passing of the VT API Key instead of requiring the python code be modified manually

    * Fixes:

		- Fixed bug when encrypting/decrypting hexadecimal objects (Thanks to Timo Hirvonen for the feedback)
		- Fixed silly bug related to abbreviated PDF Filters
		- Fixed bug related to the GNU readline function not handling correctly colorized prompts
		- Fixed log_output function, it was storing the previous command output instead of the current one

	* Known issues
	
		- It exists a problem related to the readline module in Mac OS X (it uses editline instead of GNU readline), not handling correctly colorized prompts.
